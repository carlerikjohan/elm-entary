# elm-entary

My humble attempt at learning Elm and all of it's functional awesomeness!

So in order to try and increase my knowledge of this Elm stuff I decided I would do something along the lines of something Sherlock Holmes inspired, because of, well, the "Elementary my deer Watson" quote.

So I am assuming Sherlock Holmes is good at knowing who said what, and with this knowledge you can now pretend you are Sherlock Holmes with his vast knowledge of quotes!

Or should I phrase it: Are you as good as Sherlock Holmes at knowing who said what?

## Background

Not much of a background more than that I wanted to learn some Elm.

## Running

All you have to do after installing the necessary dependencies (which I assume should just be doing any normal node install command) all you need to do if you are using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is to run:

```console
$ yarn start
```

or if you are using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```console
$ npm start
```

## FAQ

### 1. Are you actually Sherlock Holmes in disguise?

Most likely no.

### 2. What's your though on Elm?

I will hopefully update this, but so far I really like the concept of it although have to admit I have not gotten the hang of the syntax yet.
